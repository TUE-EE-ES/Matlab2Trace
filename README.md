For more details on the Trace tool: https://www.esi.nl/solutions/trace/index.dot.

# Prerequisites
Matlab and Trace tools are installed.
Install Trace by following the steps from https://www.esi.nl/solutions/trace/trace-getting-started.dot.

# Steps to run the demo
1.	Copy both toTrace.m and toTraceDemo.m to the same folder
2.	Run toTraceDemo.m
This will generate three files: traceMatlab.etf, traceMatlab2.etf and config.txt 	
3.	Copy the files from step 2 to the TRACE workspace directory you have created during step 3.
4.	Open the \*.etf files in ESI TRACE viewer.
